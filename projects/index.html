    <h2>Bloodline Champions Wiki</h2>
    <p>In 2011 I launched a wiki used to cover information surrounding the up-and-coming arena game <a href="//bloodlinechampions.com">Bloodline Champions</a>. This meant creating an environment, using MediaWiki plus various plugins, for people to create and collaborate on information regarding the game and the surrounding eSports scene which was developing around it. Furthermore, as the site became more popular I had to maintain the Debian server which the site was running on.</p>

    <h2>PlayerPowered</h2>
    <p>A small gaming blog managed by myself and some guys I knew online back in 2011. The main selling point was that the readers got to decide what was written about next. Working with Wordpress and some custom tools, the site carried on for several months before it was closed due to a lack of time to write, what with University etc.</p>

    <h2>GamerFM</h2>
    <p>Internet radio aimed at people playing online games. Founded in 2008, it included the 24/7 streaming of music over an Icecast server combined with a complete custom website solution written in PHP using MySQL. Technical work included developing a brand, website and various tools so people could listen as well as interact with the people live on-air. Aside from that, most of the work was in developing relationships with gaming communities as well as the day-to-day management of the radio itself.</p>
    <p>The radio grew to approximately 400-500 concurrent listeners and just over 10,000 active forum users, maintained by up to 30 volunteer staff. Said staff also went on to broadcast for GamerFM live at the Insomnia Gaming Festival in Summer 2010.</p>
