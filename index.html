    Hi, I'm Jimmy. I'm an Engineering Leader based in London. Currently, I work
    for <a href="https://freetrade.io">Freetrade</a> and previously at
    at <a href="https://thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>. I usually
    blog about things that are racking my brains, or problems I'm tackling at
    the moment.

  <p>I hope you find these helpful, or at least interesting!</p>
