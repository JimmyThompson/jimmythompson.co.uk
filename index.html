  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <p>My name is James Thompson, but everyone calls me Jimmy. I'm a recent graduate of Manchester Metropolitan University and now a Graduate Developer at ThoughtWorks.</p>
  <p>I've been lucky enough to write about my experiences and flex my skills on numerous projects, attending several hackathons including <a href="//hackmanchester.com">Hack Manchester</a>, <a href="//studenthack.com">StudentHack</a> and <a href="//hacked.io/">Hacked.io</a>. I've also been quite active on Github and am a former chair of the <a href="//mmucs.co.uk">MMU Computing Society</a>.
