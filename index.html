  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <p>My name is James Thompson, but everyone calls me Jimmy. I'm a software developer and a final year student at Manchester Metropolitan University doing a Bachelors in Computer Science, recently returning from a placement at <a href="//www.cdl.co.uk">CDL</a>.</p>
  <p>Whilst not studying, you can usually catch me breaking things in Ruby, Python or <a href="//golang.org">Go</a>. I've been lucky enough to talk about my experiences and flex my skills on numerous projects as well as attend several hackathons including <a href="//hackmanchester.com">Hack Manchester</a>, <a href="//studenthack.com">StudentHack</a> and <a href="//hacked.io/">Hacked.io</a>. I also contribute to several open source projects on Github, as well as act as Chairman of the <a href="//mmucs.co.uk">MMU Computing Society</a>.</p>
