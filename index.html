  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Jimmy Thompson, I'm a Senior Developer, working for
    <a href="https://thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a> in London.</p>
  <p>
    I've been lucky to have the opportunity to work on many exciting projects
    around big data engineering, product development, infosec, and the
    government's digital transformation.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also get involved in the London tech community, volunteering for
    <a href="https://railsgirls.london">Rails Girls</a> and
    <a href="https://studentrobotics.org">Student Robotics</a>.
