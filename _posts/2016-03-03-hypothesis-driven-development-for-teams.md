title: Driving your team forward with Hypothesis-Driven Development

               Using hypothesis-driven development to run experiments and 
               improve your team.

It was a Monday afternoon, and our team retrospective. Every two weeks we'd sit 
down and discuss what happened since the previous one, but this time it was 
different. This time we were focused entirely on one epic. For this epic we'd 
decided to experiment in splitting the work differently, and we wanted to know 
how people thought it went. The typical deluge of post-its went up on the wall, 
we voted on the most interesting, and we got down to discussing them. The 
conversation that followed wasn't any sort of critical analysis, but rather an 
argument about ideals, and what we _should_ be doing. By the end of it, we knew 
no more than when we started.

The problem? Nobody remembered why we'd split it differently in the first place.

In the time between deciding to experiment and measuring the results, we'd lost
context. It wasn't anybody's fault. It had taken over a month to deliver on 
the work. We just didn't invest in maintaining any log of _why_ things were
done.

Attempts at maintaining a shared context always seem to focus on _what_ has been 
done, rather than why it was done. You join a team and you're given access to a 
huge wiki explaining each component in the system, typically accompanied 
with a huge architecture diagram explaining how everything fits together. Maybe 
a decision log which explains why technical decisions were made. Attempts to 
improve a team are, however, usually buried in some sort of retrospective log,
with no real explanation of what drove the actions, or ceremonies, that the team
now take for granted. I think there's a better way to structure improvement
within a team, and that is by embracing hypothesis-driven development.

[Hypothesis-driven development](http://barryoreilly.com/2013/10/21/how-to-implement-hypothesis-driven-development/)
(HDD) is a practice which brings the scientific method to developing software. 
Instead of stories, which are about delivering specific pieces of value, you 
perform experiments. These experiments test hypotheses; which are expected to
achieve a certain outcome. We can take this concept and apply it to a team, 
creating *team experiments*.

I imagine a world where teams maintain a wall of experiments, which they use to
assess changes to the way they work. Retrospectives become about assessing 
experiments are already running, talking through the current state of the team, 
and deciding which new experiments to run.

Building and improving effective teams is about learning what works for you, and
the best way to do that is through trying new things and seeing what sticks. HDD
is a great opportunity to test your ideas and also provide a lasting log of your 
team's growth.
