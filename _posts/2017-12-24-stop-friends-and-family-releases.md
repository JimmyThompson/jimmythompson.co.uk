I really hate it when a startup goes with “friends and family” releases rather
than finding real customers. So here’s some canned responses to reasons I’ve
been told why we should go and speak to friends rather than to our early
adopters.

### But it’s not ready for the public yet

Unless it's completely useless, you don't know whether it's ready yet. The
sooner you get out and speak to your customers, the sooner you learn about what
works and what doesn't. It's better to start this journey now with a handful of
early adopters than launch in six months with all your imagined features.

### But we're in stealth

Stealth doesn’t mean isolating yourselves from your customers. It’s more likely
your startup will fail because nobody wants your product than because a
competitor learns about your product, drops everything they’re already doing,
and then beats you to market.

### But they invested

If they're in the target market, see ["But they are in the target market"](#but-they-are-in-the-target-market).

If they're not, give them a demo instead. They won't be able give you meaningful
feedback.

### But what if our competitors see it?

See ["But we're in stealth"](#but-were-in-stealth).

### But we don't know who will like it yet

Why are you building a product without an idea of who needs it?

Figure out who might need your product, then go show them instead. You’ll then
be able to build something that definitely solves their problems rather than
guessing what their problems are.

### But they are in the target market

If your target market is pretty much everyone, then you're unlikely to find a
problem common between them that you can solve effectively. [Pick a target market][target].

If you have a specific market in mind for your product, and some of your friends
and family fall into it, this is probably the exception. But beware, they aren't
a neutral party. Even if they don't use it, they'll likely tell you they love it
anyway.

## Why do I need to find my early adopters?

Pleasing your early adopters is how you enter your market and gain traction. At
the beginning of your startup journey, you should be finding a group of people
poorly served by your competitors, and collaborating with them to build
something they can use.

If you're not your target market, you need to know them well. You can't build
something in isolation from them and expect them to use it.
